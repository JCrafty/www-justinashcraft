The world needs change! Change that makes a difference to everyone. No matter your education, location or religion. No, I'm not running for office. The change I'm referring to is financial inclusion, and the "new money" is your data. You and contributions have value and you have the right to control and exchange that value. I believe Blockchain technology can make this change happen and I want to be a part of putting this opportunity in the hands of billions of people around the world. If you or your business is working on a similar passion I'd love to be a part of your team.

I'm technologist with over 15 years experience planning, designing and developing insurance and financial business solutions. I work with business partners and stakeholders to develop products and services to help people consume and digest complex data. I've traveled to India and trained dozens of programmers, learned to leverage new and emerging technologies and enjoy collaborating together to build solutions that are easy to understand and use.
